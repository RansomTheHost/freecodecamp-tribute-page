      <p>Who and what is Maze Ransomware, and where did they go?</p>

          <p>The notorious Ransomware group known for stealing data from their targets and using methods advanced for their time, disappeared not much longer after many successful, yet unfortunate data extortion based cyber assaults and got away with it. This was all done in less than five years, until finally announcing to throw in the towel, or keyboard if you may, and making off with millions of dollars in bitcoin as well as data to boot. Still at large, they seemed to have disappeared completely. Since their appearance and disappearance, many other notorious ransomware gangs emerged. They became noticed in 2019, however come 2020, decided to throw in their keyboards so to speak, due to their perspective of ignorance their targets were exhibiting towards data security and lack there of. When they announced this, their reasons were due to the carelessness of their targets security with their data. Then claimed to return when society catches up to their standards and expectations, but not leaving without warning about other groups like-minded continuing the same cyber attacks.

            <h3 id="headline">List of known groups that came after Maze:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Conti</strong></li>
              <li><strong>REvil</strong></li>
              <li><strong>DarkSide</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Clop</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Ryuk</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Netwalker</strong></li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We still have yet to fully grasp how one group can suddenly disappear after such high-priority threat level was placed on their group due to the targets and their successful cybercrime spree that seemed to be reason for why they are the face of todays digital extortion era we currently face now. It may never be a mystery we will be able to decrypt ourselves, however, their reign of cyber-terrorism left a brilliant future for cyber security that will continue to advance further all thanks to Maze. Will Maze finally return? Will their members ever be caught? Maybe we will never know.</p>
